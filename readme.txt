There's a file limit of 25MB on GitHub, which means we had to compress our csv-files. Keep in mind to unzip them before you try to run code. The raw Flickr data couldn't even be compressed into a single file smaller than 25MB, it is available on request.

We divided the work into everyone having their own 'territory', so every map is coded by a different person. The integration of all data takes place in the Flickr_BAG folder.
